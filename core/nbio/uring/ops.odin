File sync. See also fsync(2).

Optionally off and len can be used to specify a range within the file to be synced rather than syncing the entire file, which is the default behavior.

Note that, while I/O is initiated in the order in which it appears in the submission queue, completions are unordered.
For example, an application which places a write I/O followed by an fsync in the submission queue cannot expect the fsync to apply to the write.
The two operations execute in parallel, so the fsync may complete before the write is issued to the storage.
The same is also true for previously issued writes that have not completed prior to the fsync.
To enforce ordering one may utilize linked SQEs,
IOSQE_IO_DRAIN or wait for the arrival of CQEs of requests which have to be ordered before a given request before submitting its SQE.

Poll the fd specified in the submission queue entry for the events specified in the poll_events field.

Unlike poll or epoll without EPOLLONESHOT, by default this interface always works in one shot mode.
That is, once the poll operation is completed, it will have to be resubmitted.

If IORING_POLL_ADD_MULTI is set in the SQE len field, then the poll will work in multi shot mode instead.
That means it'll repatedly trigger when the requested event becomes true, and hence multiple CQEs can be generated from this single SQE.
The CQE flags field will have IORING_CQE_F_MORE set on completion if the application should expect further CQE entries from the original request.
If this flag isn't set on completion, then the poll request has been terminated and no further events will be generated.
This mode is available since 5.13.

This command works like an async poll(2) and the completion event result is the returned mask of events.

Without IORING_POLL_ADD_MULTI and the initial poll operation with IORING_POLL_ADD_MULTI the operation is level triggered,
i.e. if there is data ready or events pending etc.
at the time of submission a corresponding CQE will be posted.
Potential further completions beyond the first caused by a IORING_POLL_ADD_MULTI are edge triggered.

Issue the equivalent of a socket(2) system call.

See also socket(2) for the general description of the related system call.

Available since 5.19.

If the file_index field is set to a positive number, the file won't be installed into the normal file
table as usual but will be placed into the fixed file table at index file_index - 1.
In this case, instead of returning a file descriptor, the result will contain either 0 on success or an error.
If the index points to a valid empty slot, the installation is guaranteed to not fail.
If there is already a file in the slot, it will be replaced, similar to IORING_OP_FILES_UPDATE.
Please note that only uring has access to such files and no other syscall can use them.
See IOSQE_FIXED_FILE and IORING_REGISTER_FILES.
